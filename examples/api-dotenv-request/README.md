# README

This Haskell program demonstrates how to make a simple HTTP GET request using the `http-req` library. The program reads the API endpoint URI from the environment variables, sends a request to retrieve data, and prints the response status.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure to set up a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

```
API_URI=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```

## Usage

Run the executable to make the HTTP request:

```bash
./executableName
```

Replace `executableName` with the actual name of the executable generated by the build process.

## Configuration

The program uses the `req` library for making HTTP requests. The API endpoint URI is loaded from the `API_URI` environment variable specified in the `.env` file.

## Example

For this example, the program makes a request to the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) API, specifically fetching the data for the post with ID 1.

## Notes

- Make sure to set the `API_URI` environment variable before running the program.
- The program uses a fake user agent: "Haskell Network.HTTP.Req."

If the `API_ENDPOINT` environment variable is not set, the program will display an error message.
